# ASP.NET Hosting samples

These samples show how to use the Azure Relay ASP.NET Core extension with a simple self-hosted 
application as well as with a complete web site generated from one of the ASP.NET Core 
templates.

* **[MVCServerApp](./MVCServerApp)** is a largely unmodified ASP.NET MVC application as generated
  by the ASP.NET Core templates in Visual Studio that has been modified to run behind the Azure 
  Relay. Many ASP.NET Core applications, including those that host REST APIs, can be exposed 
  through the Relay in this fashion.
* **[SelfHostServer](./SelfHostServer)** is a minimal self-host ASP.NET Core application that 
  handles a simple request.
